I can't believe your calling me
Did you run out of things to do
Are you bothered by my old memory
Has guilt got the best of you
I can't imagine what you'd want with me
You must have come up short tonight
But I thought you were happy being free
But your voice tells me that's not right
Guess things are tough all over
Even on the single side of town
I guess it's harder than you thought it be
Without my loving arms around
And now the beating of your lonely heart
Is the cold nights only sound
Guess things are tough all over
When old memories get you down
Well you ask me if I think about you
What are you expecting me to say
Well I do but I can live without you
It's too late to ask anyway
So if you're calling for sympathy
Cause I'm getting harder to forget
I won't be a one night remedy
To help you live with your regret
Guess things are tough all over
Even on the single side of town
I guess it's harder than you thought it be
Without my loving arms around
And now the beating of your lonely heart
Is the cold nights only sound
Guess things are tough all over
When old memories get you down
